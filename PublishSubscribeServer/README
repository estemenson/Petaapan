This project provides the server component for a Python based distributed
publish/subscribe mechanism. The initial implementation is setup to be hosted
in Google App Engine but it would not be difficult to port it to a standard
web server environment such as Apache.

The client library which will provide access to the server will be implemented
in the project PublishSubscribeClient (not yet started).
