The petaapan directory in the src directory is a symbolic link needed to support the Google App Engine
development environment. It makes the modules we use from the Utilities project available to the
GAE development server. Do not try to use it for normal access to the utility classes!

Read this document for an excellent short introduction to symbolic links
(particularly for Windows users)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link

When you first clone this repository you should create the symbolic link as follows:

On Linux or other Unix-like systems

ln -s <path-to-eclipse-workspace>/utilities/petaapan petaapan

Windows instructions:

On Windows 7 and Windows Vista
Use the mklink command which is part of the standard distribution

You need to create a directory junction, so assuming you are in
${workspace_loc}\PublishSubscribeServer\src
use the following command invocation

mklink petaapan ..\..\utilities\src\petaapan /J

On Windows XP and Windows 2000
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link for details on where to get
appropriate utilities.
