This project contains various Python utility modules used by other projects
developed by Petaapan.org. It is due for a substantial refactoring in the near
future when a number of modules will move into the PublishSubscribeClient
project (not yet started)

Module Index
reportException - gathers full information about an exception and provides a
                  default logging capability.
sendJsonMsg     - sends a Json message to another computer and returns the
                  response.
stringHandler   - provides a simple standard Python log handler based on
                  StringIO that is intended for use in unit tests to verify
                  that logging is happening as intended.
